Abstract. This bitcoin model uses a geometrical spiral representation of the number π as a key to align all bitcoin price cycles into a mathematical chain of time. Users of this model can both forecast and validate each and every bitcoin price cycle’s length from start to finish using a completed cycle length as input. The pattern has been building over a 15-year timespan, bitcoin’s entire life. No user input is required and the mathematical calculations are fully complete. Color-coded charts are provided for the user to view all cycles graphically. Each cycle will have a start and end degree position on the spiral key. Every completed cycle will have an actual duration and a model duration. Compare the difference between acutal and model for validation.
