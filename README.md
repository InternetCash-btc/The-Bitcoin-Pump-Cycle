The Pump Cycle - The Connection Between Crop Circles and Bitcoin

There is a clear correlation between the Wiltshire, UK Pi crop circle and bitcoin's cyclical behavior. Both came into form
during the summer of 2008, in the same location. The crop circle can be used as a key to foretell bitcoin's cyclical future.
This mathematical workbook was created to help users understand and decode the deliberate message left for us to find.

Background:
The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on August 18th, 2008. The bitcoin whitepaper was released on October 31st, 2008. 
The PI crop circle in Wiltshire, UK was created in June of 2008.
Satoshi was actively developing bitcoin when a mathematical puzzle appeared over England during the same timeframe.
The bitcoin blockchain left users a clue. A note found in the genesis block reads: 
<p>
</p>
“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” 
<p>
</p>
Banks all over the world were receiving bailouts during this time period. Why pick a British newspaper report? Perhaps it was a hint,
instructing users exactly where to look for the hidden pattern that foretells bitcoin's cyclical behavior.

In July of 2024 on the What is Money podcast (EP495) entrepreneur Robert Edward Grant informed listeners of the Japanese Kanji  
translation of ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’. Kanji are Chinese characters that were introduced to Japan in the 5th century.
In Japanese Kanji, ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ translates to ‘wisdom from the field’.  Maybe we should consider the wisdom found in a
wheat field in the south of England circa June 2008.

I assert whoever or whatever created this agricultural artwork in the south of England in 2008 wanted humanity to discover the true 
potential of the number Pi and its relationship to sound money, and perhaps more.

This mathematical model is relatively simple, independently auditable, and uses past cycle data to forecast upcoming cycle lengths. 
Its accuracy is eye-opening.

Once you see the pattern, it becomes obvious. The current cycle started on 12/17/2017 and ends on 9/1/2026.
