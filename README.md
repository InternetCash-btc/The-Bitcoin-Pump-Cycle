Abstract. There is a clear connection between bitcoin's cyclical price movements and the Pi crop circle that appeared in Wiltshire, UK in June of 2008.
The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on August 18th, 2008. The bitcoin whitepaper was released on October 31st, 2008. 
Satoshi was actively developing bitcoin when a mathematical puzzle appeared over England during the same timeframe.
The bitcoin blockchain left users a clue. A note found in the genesis block reads: 
<p>
</p>
“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” 
<p>

</p>
Banks all over the world were receiving bailouts during this time period. Why pick a British newspaper report? Perhaps it was a hint,
instructing users exactly where to look for the hidden pattern that foretells bitcoin's cyclical behavior. In July of 2024 on the What is Money podcast (EP495)
entrepreneur Robert Edward Grant revealed something original when he informed listeners of the Japanese Kanji translation of ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’. 
Kanji are Chinese characters that were introduced to Japan in the 5th century. In Japanese Kanji, ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ translates to ‘wisdom from the field’.  
Maybe we should consider the wisdom found in a wheat field in the south of England circa June 2008.

I assert whoever or whatever created this agricultural artwork in the south of England in 2008 wanted humanity to discover the true potential of the number Pi 
and its relationship to the leading financial asset of the last 16 years, bitcoin.

This mathematical model uses past cycle data to forecast upcoming cycle lengths. Its accuracy is undeniable. Please see the two instructional videos for more information. 
Once you see the pattern, it becomes obvious.
